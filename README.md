# Resource plugin for Play Framework 2
use it like an amazon s3 bucket.
It will only store one version of a file since it computes the sha1 hash of the file and uses that as a pathname.

## Add plugin to dependencies
```scala
// in you're build.sbt file

val appDependencies = Seq(
	"se.digiplant" %% "play-res" % "1.3.0"
)

// To simplify the reverse routing we can import the digiPlant namespace
TwirlKeys.templateImports += "se.digiplant._"
```

## Add to `conf/application.conf`
```
# Resource plugin save directory
# is relative to app, but can be absolute to filesystem also
res.default=res/default
```

## Add to `conf/routes`
```
GET    /res/:file      @se.digiplant.res.ResAssets.at(file)

# If you wan't to separate your resources into separate sources, you can add multiple routes

GET    /images/:file      @se.digiplant.res.ResAssets.at(file, "images")

```

# Usage

## Reverse routing
The play-res plugin generates a unique sha1 hash of the file and stores the file on disk in an optimal `4char/4char/sha1hash.ext` directory structure.
By only having to save the fileuid (5564ac5e3968e77b4022f55a23d36630bdeb0274.jpg) to the db it's easy to retrieve the image or other document.

Here are a few examples on how to get files
```html
<img src="@res.routes.ResAssets.at("5564ac5e3968e77b4022f55a23d36630bdeb0274.jpg")" alt="" />
```

Or if you wan't to get the route to an file stored in a different source
```html
<img src="@res.routes.ResAssets.at("5564ac5e3968e77b4022f55a23d36630bdeb0274.jpg", "images")" alt="" />
```

# Advanced Usage
You can specify multiple sources if you would like to split you resources into categories, such as profile images / uploads.
By then adding another source in `conf/application.conf`

```
res.profile=res/profile
```

you will also have to add another route

```
GET    /profile/:file      @se.digiplant.res.ResAssets.at(file, "profile")
```
